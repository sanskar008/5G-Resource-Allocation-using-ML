# 5G Resource Allocation using ML

## 📘 Overview

This project explores the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to optimize resource allocation in 5G networks. By leveraging ML models, the goal is to enhance bandwidth management, reduce latency, and improve overall network efficiency.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook for interactive development

## 🧪 ML Models Implemented

- **Linear Regression**: Applied for baseline resource allocation prediction.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Enhanced model to capture nonlinear relationships.
- **XGBoost**: Advanced gradient boosting model for improved accuracy.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanskar008/5G-Resource-Allocation-using-ML.git
   cd 5G-Resource-Allocation-using-ML
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook 5G_Resource_Allocation.ipynb
   ```

### Running the Project

Open the notebook and execute the cells sequentially to train the models and visualize the results.
